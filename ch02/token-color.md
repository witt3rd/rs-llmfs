# Token Visualization in Documentation

Tokenized text in blogs and documentation is often visually presented using syntax highlighting techniques, similar to how programming code is displayed in modern editors. Here's how this is commonly accomplished:

## Color Coding Techniques

- **Color Coding by Token Type:** Each token (such as a word, punctuation, number, or operator) is assigned a category—like keyword, string, number, or identifier. Different colors are then applied to each category. For example, in a code sample, keywords (`if`, `else`) might be blue, strings in green, numbers in orange, and comments in gray.

- **Consistent and Thematic Coloring:** The color scheme (theme) can be standardized across a blog or documentation to help with readability. Many platforms allow you to choose or customize these color schemes, ensuring each token type is consistently styled throughout the document.

- **Token Borders, Backgrounds, or Effects:** In some cases, tokens might not only differ by color, but also by font style (italic, bold), background shading, or underline to indicate further semantic meaning or errors.

- **Use of Syntax Highlighting Libraries:** For web-based presentation, libraries like Pygments, Prism.js, or Highlight.js are commonly used. They automatically tokenize the text and apply the corresponding HTML and CSS to colorize each token appropriately.

- **Interactive Token Overlays:** Advanced documentation may even provide tooltips or allow users to hover over tokens to see their meaning, type, or a description—especially in educational or debugging blogs.

## Two-Step Approach

Underlying this presentation is a two-step approach:

1. **Tokenization:** Text is broken into discrete tokens based on programmatic or linguistic rules.
2. **Mapping & Theming:** Each token is mapped to a style rule defined by a theme, which assigns a color and optionally other effects.

This approach makes it easier for readers to quickly identify different components of a text or code snippet, improving comprehension and the ability to follow technical explanations, especially in complex NLP, coding, or AI/ML documentation.

## Terminal Color Output in Rust

To present tokenized (color-coded) text output in the terminal for command-line Rust applications, you have several ergonomic crate options that simplify both colored text and full syntax highlighting:

### General Terminal Coloring Crates

- **colored**: The most popular crate for coloring and styling terminal output. It lets you colorize text, specify backgrounds, and apply styles (bold, underline, etc.) with chaining methods:

  ```rust
  use colored::*;
  println!("{}", "keyword".blue().bold());
  println!("{}", "string".bright_green());
  println!("{}", "number".red().underline());
  ```

  You can combine styles and it supports RGB values for truecolor in supporting terminals.

- **termcolor**: Provides a more platform-neutral and robust API, especially for applications needing compatibility with Windows consoles, as well as buffering and granular stream management. It's used by other Rust CLI tools for reliable output.

- **colored_text, colour, and rusty-termcolor**: Other crates such as `colored_text` and `colour` offer similar functionality with various APIs or ergonomic differences. `rusty-termcolor` provides effects like gradients, typewriter animation, etc.

### Syntax Highlighting Crates

- **syntect**: A powerful syntax highlighter using Sublime Text grammar files, supporting hundreds of languages. It can turn source code into colored ANSI or HTML, allowing you to theme tokens by type for terminal display. This is ideal for showing language-specific tokenized coloring, not just single-line highlighting.

- **syntect-tui**: For rich, TUI-based (Text User Interface) apps using crates like `ratatui`, this crate bundles syntect highlighting directly for easy rendering of highlighted code in a TUI context.

- **inkjet**: Another batteries-included syntax highlighting crate, bundling many language grammars and offering terminal-friendly output.

- **synoptic**: A more modular, low-level text tokenization and highlighting library that can be adapted to terminal displays with unicode and flexible coloring.

### Example: CLI Coloring with the `colored` Crate

```rust
use colored::*;

fn main() {
    println!("{}", "fn".blue().bold());                // Function keyword (blue, bold)
    println!("{}", "\"string literal\"".green());        // String literal (green)
    println!("{}", "1234".yellow());                   // Number (yellow)
    println!("{}", "// comment".truecolor(128,128,128));// Comment (gray)
}
```

### How This Enables Token Coloring

To visualize tokenized text, you split text into linguistic or syntactic tokens (using your own lexer, or a crate like `syntect`). Then print each token using the color/styling rule that matches its type. You can build a simple map from token categories (e.g., keyword, string, number) to Rust `colored` or `termcolor` styles and print accordingly.

## Summary Table: Top Color and Highlighting Crates for Rust CLIs

| Crate           | Purpose                 | Terminal Features                              |
|-----------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| colored         | General-purpose color, style | Easy syntax, RGB, chaining                |
| termcolor       | Robust cross-platform   | Windows support, buffered output              |
| syntect         | Syntax highlighting     | Uses grammar files for full source highlighting|
| inkjet          | Syntax highlighting     | Bundled languages, terminal & HTML output     |
| coloured_text   | Simple color, style     | Styles, backgrounds, RGB, chaining            |
| colour          | Lightweight color       | ANSI standard color styling                   |
| rusty-termcolor | Color, effects          | Gradients, animations, terminal utils         |

## Summary

Rust makes CLI token coloring straightforward—use `colored` for simple coloring, and `syntect` (or similar) for robust, grammar-aware syntax highlighting and color-coded tokenization in the terminal.
